# Project Plan

Each section of the project plan will be in its own markdown file. Below is the expected content of each file.

## Overview

### README.md

Provide a short introduction, summary and functional overview of what your project group is trying to achieve and implement. Give the context within the greater system and application.

## Scope (Scenarios covered)

### scope.md

Define the scope of your development and what you will deliver in terms of use cases.  List all the scenarios you will be supporting. Link to the workflow diagrams when appropriate. Do not forget about error cases, which will include node and service failures and the recovery that is expected.

## Distributed System Challenges

### challenges.md

Identify the use cases and reasons why your system and/or components need to be distributed. Explain how and why "going distributed" solves the issues. Identify and list the resultant distributed system challenges that you need to address. For each challenge or issue, explain how you propose to address it. If you do not plan on addressing a particular challenge, explain why it is not critical and out of scope for your project. Indicate how it could be addressed in "phase two" of your project.

## Workflow Diagrams (BPMN)

### workflow.md

Display workflow diagrams for each of your supported use cases. Link to the scope and architecture documents where appropriate.

## Software Architecture Diagrams (C4)

### architecture.md

Define your architecture using C4 diagrams to visualize the system. Be sure to indicate where and how redundancy is used in your system. Reference workflow and the distributed challenges documents where appropriate.

## Tools & Technologies

### technologies.md

List the tools and technologies you plan on using. For each, explain why you decided to use that particular tool or technology. List other options you evaluated and explain why you chose not to use them.
