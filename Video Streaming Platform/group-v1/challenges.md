# Distributed System Challenges

> *Identify the use cases and reasons why your system and/or components need to be distributed. Explain how and why "going distributed" solves the issues. Identify and list the resultant distributed system challenges that you need to address. For each challenge or issue, explain how you propose to address it. If you do not plan on addressing a particular challenge, explain why it is not critical and out of scope for your project. Indicate how it could be addressed in "phase two" of your project.*


1. Consistency and Coherency:
  - Achieving strong consistency across distributed S3 nodes can be complex due to the massive scale and concurrent writes.
  - Ensuring that all replicas of an object are consistent and coherent is crucial for data integrity.
2. Durability and Availability:
  - S3 is designed for high durability, but achieving this across a large number of nodes while maintaining availability can be challenging.
  - Balancing data replication, fault tolerance, and recovery mechanisms is essential.
3. Latency and Throughput:
  - S3 must handle read and write requests efficiently, even with a large number of concurrent users.
  - Minimizing latency while maintaining high throughput is a constant challenge.
4. Scalability and Load Balancing:
  - As the number of users and data grows, S3 must scale horizontally to accommodate the load.
  - Proper load balancing across nodes is critical to prevent bottlenecks.
5. Data Partitioning and Sharding:
  - Distributing data across nodes (sharding) while ensuring balanced partitions is complex.
  - Deciding how to split data and manage metadata efficiently is a challenge.
6. Data Integrity and Corruption:
  - Detecting and handling data corruption or inconsistencies due to hardware failures or network issues is crucial.
  - Implementing checksums and error detection mechanisms is essential.
7. (Security and Access Control):
  - Managing access control lists (ACLs), encryption, and authentication for millions of objects and users is challenging.
  - Ensuring data privacy and preventing unauthorized access is a constant concern.
8. Versioning and Lifecycle Policies:
  - Supporting versioning and managing object lifecycle (e.g., expiration, archiving) can be complex.
  - Properly handling object versions and transitions is critical.
9. Metadata Management:
  - Efficiently storing and querying metadata (e.g., object properties, tags) for billions of objects is a challenge.
  - Balancing metadata storage with data storage is essential.
10. Monitoring and Diagnostics:
  - Monitoring the health, performance, and behavior of S3 nodes is crucial.
  - Detecting anomalies, bottlenecks, and failures in real-time is challenging.
