# Distributed System Challenges

> *Identify the use cases and reasons why your system and/or components need to be distributed. Explain how and why "going distributed" solves the issues. Identify and list the resultant distributed system challenges that you need to address. For each challenge or issue, explain how you propose to address it. If you do not plan on addressing a particular challenge, explain why it is not critical and out of scope for your project. Indicate how it could be addressed in "phase two" of your project.*
