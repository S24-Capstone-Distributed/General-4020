# Technologies Used in the Project

## Java
- **Reason for Use:** Extensive familiarity and expertise with Java within the team.
- **Considered Alternatives:** Python, due to its simplicity and suitability for AWS S3 interactions. However, lack of team expertise and potential longer development time led to the decision not to use it.

## JUnit and Maven
- **Reason for Use:** Robust and automated testing facilitated by JUnit, integrated with Maven for streamlined project setup and dependency management.
- **Considered Alternatives:** None, as JUnit and Maven are widely adopted and well-suited for Java projects.

## Docker
- **Reason for Use:** Lightweight containerization for consistent deployment across environments.
- **Considered Alternatives:** Other containerization solutions, but Docker's ease of use and popularity made it the preferred choice.

## Kubernetes
- **Reason for Use:** Orchestration and management of containerized services for scalability and resilience.
- **Considered Alternatives:** Other orchestration tools, but Kubernetes' extensive features and community support made it the preferred choice.

## RabbitMQ
- **Reason for Use:** Reliable messaging system with support for various messaging patterns.
- **Considered Alternatives:** Apache Kafka, but RabbitMQ's simplicity and seamless integration with Java favored its selection.

## h264 Codec
- **Reason for Use:** Longevity, widespread device compatibility, extensive support, and ease of use.
- **Considered Alternatives:** Newer codecs like VP9, but their relative novelty and limited device support posed potential risks.

## HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)
- **Reason for Use:** Simplicity in implementation and widespread native support across devices and platforms.
- **Considered Alternatives:** DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP), but HLS aligned closely with current priorities and offered ease of setup and compatibility.

## FFmpeg
- **Reason for Use:** Comprehensive multimedia processing tools for efficient video segmentation and transcoding.
- **Considered Alternatives:** GStreamer, HandBrake, Libav, but FFmpeg's versatility, robustness, and widespread acceptance made it the preferred choice.

## DynamoDB
- **Reason for Use:** Simplicity, ease of management, and alignment with AWS ecosystem.
- **Considered Alternatives:** Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, Google Cloud Bigtable, but DynamoDB's simplicity, manageability, and familiarity with AWS services favored its selection.
