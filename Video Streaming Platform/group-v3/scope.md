Define the Purpose and Goals:

A. Clearly state the purpose of your distributed project. What problem does it aim to solve or what value does it provide?
	Outline specific goals that you want to achieve through the project.

B. Understand Requirements:
	Requirements are to create a distributed video processor and players that is reliable and can withstand failures. Expectations are that the system will be able to handle a large amount of visual data from multiple users without an impact on performance. It should also be able to process many video play requests simultaneously without a problem.  
	

C. Define Use Cases:
	-User login with a new profile must add them to the database.
	-Must be able to handle failure when user uploads a file, at what point are we going to tell the user the video failed and after how many retries. 
	-What happens if a user uploads something other than the proper data?
	-What happens when many users request the same video?
	-Are we going to preload individual videos to minimize the first buffer time?

1. User Management:
	User Registration and Database
		Use Case: When a new user registers and creates a profile, the system must add their information to the user database.
		Implementation Considerations: Implement a secure user registration process, including email verification and password hashing, to ensure data integrity and user security.

2. File Upload and Handling:
	Failure Handling during File Upload:
		Use Case: If a user uploads a video file, the system must be able to handle failures during the upload process.
		Implementation Considerations: Implement a robust error handling mechanism that informs the user of the failure, specifying the point of failure during the upload. Define a reasonable number of retries before notifying the user of a permanent failure.

	Invalid Data Upload:
		Use Case: If a user attempts to upload something other than the expected video file format, the system must handle this scenario gracefully.
		Implementation Considerations: Implement file format validation and provide clear feedback to users about the accepted formats. Consider implementing a pre-upload validation step to minimize unnecessary data transfer.
3. Video Request Management:
	Handling Concurrent Requests for the Same Video:
		Use Case: When many users simultaneously request the same video, the system must efficiently manage and serve those requests.
		Implementation Considerations: Implement caching strategies and load balancing to distribute requests evenly across servers. Use Content Delivery Network (CDN) to reduce server load and enhance the streaming experience.

4. Video Preloading:
	Preloading Individual Videos:
		Use Case: To minimize the initial buffer time for users, the system may preload individual videos
		Implementation Considerations: Implement a preloading mechanism where popular or trending videos are preloaded in the background to reduce latency. Consider user preferences and viewing history for personalized preloading.

5. Bandwidth Optimization:
	Bandwidth Management:
		Use Case: Optimize bandwidth usage to ensure efficient delivery of video content while minimizing costs.
		Implementation Considerations: Implement adaptive streaming techniques, such as Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) or HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), to adjust video quality based on users' network conditions, reducing unnecessary data transfer.

6. Content Storage and Retrieval:
  Efficient Content Storage:
    Use Case: Optimize the storage of video content to ensure efficient retrieval and minimize latency.
    Implementation Considerations: Utilize scalable and distributed storage solutions. Implement efficient indexing and caching mechanisms for quick content retrieval.

7. Fault Tolerance:
  Fault Recovery and Redundancy:
    Use Case: Ensure fault tolerance by implementing mechanisms to recover from server failures and minimize service downtime.
    Implementation Considerations: Utilize redundant servers, implement automated failover systems, and regularly backup critical data to prevent data loss.

8. Resource Scaling:
  Dynamic Resource Scaling:
    Use Case: Scale resources dynamically to handle varying levels of user demand and ensure optimal performance.
    Implementation Considerations: Implement auto-scaling policies based on metrics such as server load, network traffic, and storage usage.

9. Load Balancing Strategies:
  Efficient Load Balancing:
    Use Case: Distribute incoming traffic efficiently across servers to prevent overloading and optimize resource utilization.
    Implementation Considerations: Utilize load balancing algorithms based on factors like server health, available resources, and current demand.

10. Content Delivery Network (CDN) Optimization:
  CDN Integration for Global Delivery:
    Use Case: Leverage CDNs to efficiently deliver content globally, minimizing latency and improving streaming performance.
    Implementation Considerations: Integrate with reputable CDNs, configure caching policies, and dynamically route users to the nearest CDN node.

11. Error Logging and Monitoring:
  Comprehensive Error Logging:
    Use Case: Log and monitor errors across the system for effective debugging and troubleshooting.
    Implementation Considerations: Implement a centralized error logging system, integrate with monitoring tools, and set up alerts for critical issues.

12. Data Backup and Recovery:
  Regular Data Backups:
    Use Case: Implement a robust data backup strategy to prevent data loss in the event of system failures or disasters.
    Implementation Considerations: Regularly backup data to secure and geographically dispersed locations. Test data recovery procedures to ensure effectiveness.

13. Handling Network Congestion:
  Network Congestion Mitigation:
    Use Case: Mitigate the impact of network congestion on streaming quality and reliability.
    Implementation Considerations: Implement congestion control algorithms, prioritize video traffic, and dynamically adjust streaming parameters based on network conditions.
